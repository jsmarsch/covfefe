# What is Covfefe?
Just a little Windows app that runs in your task tray and keeps your computer awake.
- Use it to prevent your monitors or projector from sleeping when you are presenting.
- Use it to prevent your computer from sleeping when it is running a long running task.

### Can't I just change my power settings myself?
Sure.  _But_, you would need to remember to set them back.  Covfefe only interrrupts sleep while it is running.  Close the app, and your computer resumes its normal power plan.
